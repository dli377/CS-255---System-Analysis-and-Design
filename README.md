# CS-255---System-Analysis-and-Design

<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?<b>
	• The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client who operates a Driver’s Education business, handling both the driving and testing components. The client requested a cloud-based platform that could be accessed from any internet-enabled device, ensuring flexibility and availability for users.  

<b>What did you do particularly well?<b>
	• I took deliberate care to understand and prioritize the client’s needs. Through the Client Interview and the documentation provided, I was able to anticipate not only their immediate requirements but also potential needs as the business grows and scales.  

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<b>  
	• I would focus on further refining the UML Class Diagram and fully developing the software architecture. I believe the diagram is not yet as comprehensive as it could be. Working independently limited my perspective, and additional viewpoints might have helped create a more complete representation of the DriverPass system.  

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<b>
	• I relied heavily on the client interview, coursework, and textbook references to assess their needs from multiple angles. Considering user needs is vital because a successful system goes beyond functional code—it must offer an intuitive, user-friendly experience. Adoption is never guaranteed; the system must deliver clear value over existing processes to make the transition worthwhile for end users.  

<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?<b>  
	• My approach begins with extensive research. Most solutions build upon previous work, so reviewing existing documentation and lessons learned from similar projects is key. I also emphasize empathy—imagining the process from the end user’s perspective. A detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of their experience often reveals insights that lead to a more effective and user-centered design.
